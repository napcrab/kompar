# Introduction

This is a book to describe the language features and syntax of The Kompar Data Manipulation Language

The point of Kompar is to act as a universal language for all programmatic manipulation of human-understandable data

So it does not do anything other than take data, manipulate it in some way and return the result - hopefully with the goal of being as easy as possible for humans to understand the changes

(This is not a finished or professional project do not use in anything I dont know what i am doing - How you even found this is beyond me)
